Thanks for contributing to Hosh!

Please be sure that you read the Code of Conduct before contributing to this project and please create a new Issue and discuss first what your are planning to do for bigger changes.

The overall goal of hosh is to have a portable text based shell for Linux/MacOS/Windows.

In order to achieve that we have a strong focus on maintainability and high test coverage:

- we expect new or modified unit test for every change (written in JUnit5 + Mockito + AssertJ).

- we don't expect usage of specific system commands (e.g. /bin/sh, ifconfig, curl, etc)

If you have any question please consider asking in https://github.com/hosh-shell/hosh/discussions
For bug reports or specific code related topics create a new issue in https://github.com/hosh-shell/hosh/issues

Thanks!
